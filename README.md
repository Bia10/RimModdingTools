# RimModdingTools

## Nice to have
- Check if mod folder is valid
- Check if mod data are valid
- Sort mod load order
- Check for incompatible mods
- Check if mods are compatible with [RimThreaded](https://github.com/cseelhoff/RimThreaded)
- Donwload mods from steam via steamCmd
- Download mods from github
- Update mods
- Import/Export ModList

## Things to keep in mind
- there is no restriction on http request generated, repeated searching thru long modlist may be understood as spam by Steam.
- both Steam and Github API uses annon login, its likely that usage restictions are implied
